## Known issues

- [ ] **sops-nix `age.keyFile` fallback doesn't actually fire when
      `age.sshKeyPaths` fails during early boot** (torrent, discovered
      2026-08-18). `profiles/PC.nix` configures both `sops.age.sshKeyPaths
      = [ "/home/lilijoy/.ssh/id_ed25519" ]` and `sops.age.keyFile =
      "/var/lib/sops-nix/key.txt"`, with `keyFile` explicitly intended
      as the early-boot fallback since `/home` isn't mounted yet during
      initrd-stage activation (see the comment there). On a real boot,
      the initrd-stage `sops-install-secrets` run failed entirely
      (`Cannot read ssh key '/home/lilijoy/.ssh/id_ed25519': ... no such
      file or directory` immediately followed by `Error getting data
      key: 0 successful groups required, got 0`) instead of falling
      back to `keyFile` — `/run/secrets` never got populated for the
      rest of that boot (git identity, and presumably other
      home/root-critical secrets, all missing) until manually re-run
      post-boot via `run0 sops-install-secrets ...` (which then
      succeeded immediately, confirming `key.txt` itself and its
      `.sops.yaml` registration were never the problem). Looks like a
      real sops-nix bug/limitation: a failed `sshKeyPaths` entry seems
      to poison the whole identity list rather than gracefully falling
      through to `keyFile`. Needs: check for a known upstream sops-nix
      issue/fix, or restructure so boot-critical secrets don't depend on
      an identity path that's guaranteed to fail during initrd (e.g.
      drop `sshKeyPaths` from the boot-time identity list entirely and
      rely on `keyFile` alone there). Not yet reproduced against a clean
      reboot (holding off per the no-unconfirmed-local-restarts rule).
